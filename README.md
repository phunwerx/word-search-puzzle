## Synopsis

Nothing big and fancy here, just solves a 2d word puzzle by banging /usr/share/words against a few matrix view classes.

## Code Example

s = Solver.new

s.solve

pretty simple :-)

## Motivation

A friend of mine had written a word puzzle solver on Mac OS using C++ and shared the code with me, which I was able to compile and tinker with it using gnu g++ on my Linux Fedora system.  It inspired me because it's a fun and interesting problem without being too complicated, I had some time to kill, and ruby is just a wonderfully small, beautiful, and expressive language.

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:phunwerx/word-search-puzzle.git

## API Reference

N/A

## Tests

chmod 755 solve
