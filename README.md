## Synopsis

Nothing big and fancy here, just solves a 2d word puzzle by banging /usr/share/words against it.

## Code Example

s = Solver.new
s.solve

pretty simple :-)

## Motivation

A friend of mine had written a word puzzle solver on Mac OS using C++ and shared the code with me, which I was able to compile and tinker with it using gnu g++ on my Linux Fedora system.  It inspired me because it's a fun and interesting problem without being too complicated, I had some time to kill, and ruby is just a wonderfully small, beautiful, and expressive language.
