## Synopsis

Nothing big and fancy here, just solves a 2d word puzzle by banging /usr/share/words against a different views of a matrix.

## Code Example

s = Solver.new

s.solve

pretty simple

## Motivation

A friend of mine had written a word puzzle solver on Mac OS using C++ and shared the code with me, which I was able to compile and tinker with it using gnu g++ on my Fedora Linux system.  It inspired me because it's a fun and interesting problem without being too complicated and I wanted to show how ruby is just a wonderfully small, beautiful, and expressive language. :-)

## Installation

git clone git@github.com:phunwerx/word-search-puzzle.git
